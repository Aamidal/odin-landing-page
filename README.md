## TOP Project 2: Landing Page

Time to design and style a webpage from scratch! 

Outside of the minimal HTML edits required by the CSS exercises, I hadn't worked with HTML since the recipes project. It was a huge confidence booster to see how quickly the page structure came together after a moment studying the example.

Once the page's skeleton was laid out, it was just a matter of flexbox trial-and-error until everything fit where I wanted it. Luckily most of the page elements had appeared in previous exercises, and were simple enough to mock up.

The dummy content from the example has been replaced with content inspired by my ongoing Traveller RPG campaign.


The Odin Project provided these examples:


<img src="./images/desired-layout.png" alt="Odin example" height="300"> <img src="./images/example-styles.png" alt="Odin styles" height="300">
